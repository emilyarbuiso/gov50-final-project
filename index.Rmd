## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to immigration to the United States. I am interested in immigration patterns, where people are emigrating from, where they are settling, and other information related to immigration, like age, marital status, etc. I would be interested to see how this information changes over time and how it gets used in American politics.
