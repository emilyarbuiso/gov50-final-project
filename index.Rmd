## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to air quality and air pollution. I am interested in seeing how air pollution varies across different counties in the United States. I am also interested in what factors might determine this variation. I would be interested to see how air pollution varies across counties with different educational backgrounds, ages, economic productivity, etc.

## Proposal

How do different factors like educational background, economic productivity and average income affect a county's air pollution? I plan to examine how these different factors could impact the levels of certain air pollutants like NO2, 03, and PM2.5. I hypothesize that there will be negative correlations between factors such as educational background and higher air pollution. Typically, with a higher educational background, one has more knowledge of the climate/environmental science and is more aware of the factors that impact air pollution. Additionally, those with higher educational backgrounds tend to vote for more pro-environmental people that will institute policies that will decrease air pollution. The explanatory variables of interest are educational background, economic productivity, and average income. Educational background will be measured by years of education, both secondary and post-secondary. Economic productivity will be measured by GDP. Finally, average income will be measured in U.S. dollars, as the counties being considered will only be U.S. counties. The outcome variable of interest is air pollution. This will be measured by ppb (parts per billion) or ppm (parts per million) for different pollutants. The years for the data will likely be in the most recent 3 or 4 years. If I observe lower air pollution in counties with higher educational backgrounds, this would support my hypothesis. If I observe higher air pollution in countries with higher educational backgrounds, this would go against my hypothesis. Other factors will be considered, and there are other factors that will be controlled for when running the regression.
